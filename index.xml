      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Monad Transformers and Effects with Backpack&amp;rdquo;, @acid2 presented how to apply Backpack to monad transformers. There is a less-popular approach to deal with effects â€” Handle (Service) pattern. I recommend reading both posts at first since they answer many questions regarding the design decisions behind the Handle pattern (why IO, why not type classes, etc). In this post, I want to show different implementations of the Handle pattern and compare them.</description>

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Implementations of the Handle pattern&amp;rdquo;, I have explored how Backpack might be used for the Handle pattern. It helped me to take a better look at Backpack and reflect a bit on modules and records in Haskell.
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with Backpack? Backpack works as expected but there are downsides of the current implementation:
 It&amp;rsquo;s cabal-only. It means it&amp;rsquo;s hard to integrate it in any big project because developers tend to choose different build tools.</description>
